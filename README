Since it's Javascript, just run index.html. The UI should be straightfoward--Generate Points to generate random points on the canvas, click on canvas if you want to manually add points, Generate Hull to generate the convex hull (red is the sub-hulls, black final hull), and Clear to clear the canvas and the points.

I didn't add UI to change the number of points, but in js/script.js there should be minNumPoints and maxNumPoints you can set to generate number of points between [b,t].
